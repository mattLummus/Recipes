Chicken Tortilla Soup

NOTES:
* For the chicken, for soups I like to use either baked thighs or a whole roasted chicken. Skin on, bone in - no exceptions.
* It has more flavor, pulls apart easier, and ends up more moist. The skin and bones lock in flavor and moisture and help protect the meat from overcooking.
* The great thing about this method is that while you can bake your chicken yourself at home, it is just as easy to purchase a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from your grocery deli.
* While having the best result, pulling the chicken is a bit messy (sanitary gloves are your friend here) and may make some people uncomfortable. So this is just my recommendation. 
* If you are more comfortable grilling or baking skinless chicken breasts, that will work too!!


Main Ingredients:
* 1 to 1.5 Lb of Cooked Chicken (If making at home with bones in, account for about a half pound being lost due to bones being discarded - so 2lb uncooked chicken = 1.5lb cooked chicken meat)
  OR 
* 1 Store Bought Cooked Rotisserie Chicken

* 1 Large or 2 Medium Zuchini
* 1 Large or 2 Medium Cubanelle/Anaheim Peppers (You can substitute a jalapeno here if you can't find Cubanelles, but I recommend them for flavor!)
* 1 Large or 2 Medium Poblano Peppers
* 1 Bell Pepper
* 1 Lb of Carrots
* 1 Lime
* 1 Medium or Large Red Onion
* 3-4 Cloves of Garlic
* 1 Package of Sundried Tomatoes (or one 14 oz can of fire roasted tomatoes)
* 14oz Can of Black Beans (Rinsed and drained)
* 14oz of Corn (Canned, Frozen, or Cooked Fresh are all fine)
* 1.5 Carton of Chicken Stock
* 1 tablespoon  of chipotle paste (Optional. To make just take a can of "Chipotle in Adobo" and puree. This is something I keep in my fridge at all times.)

Dried Seasoning:
* 2 tablespoons of chili powder
* 1 tablespoon  of black pepper
* 2 teaspoons   of paprika (I prefer the smoked variety)
* 2 teaspoons   of cumin
* 1/4 teaspoon  of cinnamon
* 2 teaspoons   of ground thyme
* 1 Tablespoon  of Italian Blend Herbs
* Dash of Allspice (optional)

* 1 Teaspoon of Curry Powder
       OR
* 1 teaspoon   of Tumeric
* 1/4 teaspoon of Coriander (optional)


1. Mise En Place (Prep)
* Peel Zuchini and Cut Lengthwise into 4 spears
* Remove Seeds and Veins from Peppers
* Dice Your Aromatics: Onions, Peppers, Garlic and Tomatoes, if they are sundried. (A food processor is great for this task, but use the low setting and do NOT puree yet. Add the garlic and tomatoes to bottom of processor so they cut more finely)
* Peel and Slice Carrots
* Measure out your Spices

2. Grill (Optional)
* Cook Zuchini on grill or in a pan on stove top. Coat with a high smoke point cooking oil or spray such as Avocado or Canola (olive oil will burn here, so avoid if possible). High Heat and 2-3 minutes a side will sear the outside quickly. We don't need them fully cooked, just seared for flavor.
* If Cooking Chicken on stove top, now would be the time to do that too. I would recommend doing so in the same pot you are going to cook your soup in, because sauteeing your arotmatics will deglaze the bottom of the cookware for extra flavor!

3. Sautee and Boil
* Coat the bottom of the pot with olive/avocado oil and sautee aromatics over Low-Medium heat. Cook until excess moisture has just evaporated and the aromatics start to brown. (OPTIONAL: This is a good time to add some sodium, as it will aid in this step. A pinch of Salt here is fine, but a drizzle of Soy Sauce is even tastier!)
* Add Stock and Chipotle Paste. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 30 minutes so the aromatics will start to dissolve.
* Halfway through simmering stir in your your dried seasoning and then add carrots.

* (OPTIONAL) Half way through simmering, and before adding seasoning and carrots, I like to puree my stock to improve texture and help merry the flavors. 
* A blender will work best here, but a food processor will work too. Just don't overfill - this is hot liquid!

4. Final Simmer
* Add your cooked chicken, zuchini, black beans, and corn.
* Bring back up to a boil and simmer for another 20-30 minutes.

5. Serve
* Garnish with Avocado, Red Onions, Cilantro, Cheese, and Tortilla Chips
