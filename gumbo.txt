Shrimp and Sausage Gumbo
* Takes about two hours to make. There is a bit of work involved but is well worth it to make from scratch.
* This is a fairly economical meal to make. Purchased all ingredients for about $30-40 and provides 10-15 servings, although you could easily stretch it to 20.
* This is pretty spicy, although there is no cayenne. The seasoning mix lends a lot of flavor and the heat.
* If you prefer less spicy, leave out the chipotle and use half the black pepper.

Main Ingredients:
* 1qt of Vegetable Stock.
* 1 lb of shrimp, raw with shells on. Frozen is fine, but try to find them with heads still on as well.
* 1 lb of andouille sausage (chorizo also works quite nicely. If using the uncured Mexican variety, use half as much and use half the amount of olive oil)
* 1 onion
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 bunch of garlic
* 12 oz of celery
* 16 oz of chopped turnip greens (or collard, mustard, kale, etc.)
* 1 cup of orange juice
* 1/4 cup of liquor (I'm using Jack Daniels Honey)
* 1/4 cup of Olive oil

Seasoning Mixture:
* 1 tablespoon of chipotle paste (optional. To make just take a can of chipotle in adobo and puree. This is something I keep in my fridge at all times.)
* 2 tablespoons of chili powder
* 2 tablespoons of black pepper
* 1 tablespoon of ground ginger
* 2 teaspoons of paprika
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 1 teaspoon of ground corriander
* 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon
* 2 dashes of ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon of ground thyme
* 1 tablespoon of dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon of dried parsley
* 1 teaspoon of dried basil

Roux:
* 4oz of whole wheat flour
* 4oz of vegetable oil (or any oil with a high smoke point)
--preheat oven to 350F
--combine flour and oil and stir well
--Heat for 90 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes
--The easiest way to tell when done is by smell. It should have a distinct toasty aroma but not hints of burning, and a dark "red brick" color.

Seafood Stock:
--Add shrimp shells and heads, 1 qt of vegetable stock, 2 qts of water, 1 cup of orange juice, 2 bay leaves, and 1 tablespoon of rosemary
--bring to a boil and then simmer for about 45 minutes.
--Strain and then simmer for another 15.

1. Prep
* Thaw Shrimp if frozen by placing in a bowl of cold-lukewarm water. (this is important to not overcook the shrimp!)
* Remove the shells and heads. Don't throw these away. Devein if desired.
* Take the shells and start making the Seafood Stock.
* Finely chop onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Dice the celery a little thicker. This mixture is called the Holy Trinity (with the addition of garlic)

2. Sautee
* Add olive oil and brown sausage. Then remove the sausage but leave the oil. Set aside.
* In the same pan, sautee the trinity for about half an hour. Add to the sausage.
* Deglaze the pan with liqour and add to the sausage and trinity mix.

3. Boil
* When the stock is done and strained, add 1/3 back, mix in the roux, and then add back the rest. (the stock should be reduced to about 2 qts now of liquid now. If not, just add water back to replace)
* Add the seasoning mixture, trinity, sausage, and turnip greens. Simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.
* Remove from heat.
* Lastly add the shrimp to the pot and simmer for about 10 minutes before serving. There is enough residual heat to cook them through.

4. Serve
* Serve over rice and a side of carrots and cucumbers.
* I pair this with a Shiner "Prickly Pair" Summer Seasonal. Its a fairly sweet ale with a fruity front end but is not overly sugary.

(alternatively you can grill or sautee the shrimp separately and add right at the time of serving. The point is that you shouldn't overcook them because they will become tough and rubbery)
