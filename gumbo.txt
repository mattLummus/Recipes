Main Ingredients:
* 1qt of Vegetable Stock.
* 1 lb of shrimp, raw with shells on. Frozen is fine, but try to find them with heads still on as well.
* 1 lb of sausage (using andouille, although chorizo also works quite nicely)
* 1 onion
* 1 bell pepper
* 1 bunch of garlic
* 12 oz of celery
* 16 oz of turnip greens (or collard, mustard, kale, etc.)
* 1 cup of orange juice
* 1/4 cup of liquor (I'm using Jack Daniels Honey)
* 1/4 cup of Olive oil

Roux:
* 4oz of whole wheat flour
* 4oz of vegetable oil (or any oil with a high smoke point)
--preheat oven to 350F
--combine flour and oil and stir well
--Heat for 90 minutes, stirring every 15-20 minutes
--The easiest way to tell when done is by smell. It should have a distinct toasty aroma but not hints of burning, and a dark "red brick" color.

Seafood Stock:
--Add shells, 1 qt of vegetable stock, 2 qts of water, 1 cup of orange juice, 2 bay leaves, and 1 tablespoon of rosemary
--bring to a boil and then simmer for about 45 minutes.
--Strain and then boil for another 15.

Seasoning Mixture:
* 1 tablespoon of chipotle paste (optional)
* 2 tablespoons of chili powder
* 2 tablespoons of black pepper
* 1 tablespoon of ground ginger
* 2 teaspoons of paprika
* 2 teaspoons of cumin
* 1 teaspoon of ground corriander
* 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon
* dash of ground cloves
* 1 teaspoon of ground thyme
* 1 tablespoon of dried oregano
* 1 tablespoon of dried parsley
* 1 teaspoon of dried basil


1. Prep
--Finely chop onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Dice celery the celery a little thicker. This mixture is called the Holy Trinity (with the addition of garlic)
--Thaw Shrimp if frozen and remove shells. Devein if desired.

2. Sautee
--Add olive oil and brown sausage. Set aside.
--In the same pan, sautee the trinity for about half an hour. Add to sausage.
--Deglaze pan with liqour and add to sausage and trinity.
--Remove and set aside

3. Boil
--When the stock is done and strained, add 1/3 back, mix in the roux, and then add back the rest. (the stock should be reduced to about 2 qts now of liquid now. If not, just add water back to replace)
--Add the seasoning mixture, trinity, sausage, and turnip greens. Simmer on low heat for 30 minutes.
--Remove from heat.
--Lastly add the shrimp to the pot and simmer for about 10 minutes before serving. There is enough residual heat to cook them through.

4. Serve
--Serve over rice or with crackers

(alternatively you can grill or sautee the shrimp separately and add right at the time of serving. The point is that you shouldn't overcook them because they will become tough and rubbery)
